__MLPF__ is a python library for (optimal) power flow calculations with machine learning.
It offers:

* efficient loss functions compatible with both _PyTorch_ and _scikit-learn_!
* utilities such as data structures and loading pipelines that make it easy to go from
  _pandapower_ nets or _PYPOWER_ case files to arrays and tensors in just one line of code!
* visualization and description tools to take a quick look at your data
